# Business Directory CRUD app

This repository contains a complete code to a simple business directory CRUD( Create.Read.Update.Delete ) app with MERN( MongoDB.ExpressJS.React.NodeJS ) stack and Redux.

It uses Bootstrap for the look - and feel - and responsiveness. 
I have also used Formik and Yup to validate the form prior to submitting/inserting the fields into MongoDb.
